# Trip Planner Crew AI

**Trip Planner Crew AI** is an intelligent system that helps travelers plan optimal trips by leveraging Crew AI agents. The agents work collaboratively to gather information, suggest destinations, and create travel itineraries based on user preferences, ensuring a seamless travel experience.

## Features

1. **City Selection Expert**: Analyzes travel destinations based on weather, season, and prices to recommend the best cities for your trip.
2. **Local Expert**: Provides detailed insights on attractions, local customs, and activities in your selected destination.
3. **Travel Concierge**: Assists in creating an optimized itinerary based on your preferences (e.g., activities, dining, nightlife) while balancing budget and packing suggestions.
4. **Dynamic Resource Gathering**: Uses a search tool to gather up-to-date information from the web, ensuring that travel suggestions are timely and relevant.
5. **Optimized Planning**: Integrates a calculator to balance itinerary options, travel costs, and available resources.

## How It Works

### Agents
- **City Selection Expert**: Gathers real-time data from various sources and suggests the best city for your trip based on factors like current weather conditions, travel costs, and events.
- **Local Expert**: Provides personalized recommendations for activities, cultural insights, and tips on maximizing your experience in your chosen city.
- **Travel Concierge**: Builds a full travel itinerary with options for transportation, activities, and accommodations, all while adhering to your budget and preferences.

### Tools
